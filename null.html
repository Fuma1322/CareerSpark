            <h3>Institute Overview</h3>
            <p>
                The National University of Lesotho (NUL) has its roots in the establishment of the Catholic University College in Roma on April 8, 1945. Founded by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy of Southern Africa, this institution aimed to provide African Catholic students with post-matriculation education and religious guidance, fulfilling a decision made by the Synod of Catholic Bishops in South Africa in 1938. Initially located in a temporary primary school building, the College moved to its current site in 1946 after receiving a generous allocation of 52 acres of land from the Paramount Chief. By 1950, the College was ceded to the Congregation of Oblates of Mary Immaculate (OMI), which played a crucial role in its development.
                <br><br>
                Throughout the 1950s, Pius XII College began preparing students for external degrees from the University of South Africa (UNISA) and achieved “Associate College” status in 1954. This recognition marked a significant milestone, allowing the College to take greater responsibility for its academic programs and examinations. However, the early 1960s brought challenges, as financial and academic difficulties emerged, leading to a reevaluation of the College's relationship with UNISA. Despite these struggles, the College continued to produce a cadre of educated individuals who would contribute to the development of the High Commission Territories, highlighting its vital role in the region's education system.
                <br><br>
                The need for a transformative solution became clear, prompting discussions to establish a non-denominational university to serve the High Commission Territories. Progress was made, culminating in the signing of a deed of cession on June 13, 1963, backed by the Ford Foundation and the British government. This paved the way for the establishment of the University of Basutoland, Bechuanaland Protectorate, and Swaziland (UBBS) on January 1, 1964, with a charter granted by Queen Elizabeth II. The Oblate Fathers maintained a close relationship with the university, and in 1966, following independence, UBBS was renamed the University of Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland (UBLS).
                <br><br>
                In response to ongoing growth and administrative challenges, the decision to establish the National University of Lesotho was made on October 20, 1975, by the Lesotho Interim National Assembly. NUL proudly carries forward the legacy of its predecessors, occupying the same grounds in Roma while striving to meet the educational needs of the nation. Situated in the picturesque Roma Valley, the university spans 80 hectares and benefits from a temperate climate, making it an ideal location for higher education. Today, NUL is committed to producing competent graduates who are equipped to contribute to the development of Lesotho and is a member of various prestigious academic associations, including the Association of Commonwealth Universities and the Association of African Universities.
